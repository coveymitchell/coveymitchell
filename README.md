# About me
My name is Mitchell Covey and I am a senior at the University of St Thomas. I am a computer science major and I am graduating this spring. 

I enjoy rock climbing, skiing, and gaming. All of these hobbies I discovered through friends I made during my time at St Thomas. I even road tripped with my roommate to Colorado to go skiing. 

I chose computer science after my freshman year. I learned how much I enjoyed coding and decided to go for it and pursue a comp sci degree. I have had the pleasure of taking many unique and facinating classes because of the liberal arts focus St Thomas champions. My time at St Thomas has been the most impactful years of my life and I look back on my time fondly. Below are a few projects which demonstrait some of what I learned at UST.

# Personal Website
