# About me
My name is Mitchell Covey and I just graduated from the University of St THomas with a Bachelors in Computer Science. Below are a few projects I worked on during my time at college.

# Personal Website
This was the first assignment for my web dev course. The task was to create a personal website all about me. This was my first attempt at web design and I learned a lot through this assignment.

# Powerplant Dynamic Webserver
This was the second assignment for my wev dev course. Our group designed a webserver which showed off data relating to power plants around the world. This assignment was really interesting because I learned so much about counties energy usage. Seeing many large countries like the United States, China, Russia, and other countris over-reliance on fossil fuels was disheartening, but also demonstrated how important sustainable energy developments are.

# Boston Housing Predictor
This was my final assignment for my course covering deep learning. I was tasked with writing an deep learning algorithm to predict housing prices in boston. The repository includes the code and my final paper describing my findings. I enjoyed this class because it felt like a combination of my algorithms, statistics, and AI classes and helped me understand deep learning as it relates to machine learning and artificial intelligence.
