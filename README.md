# About me
My name is Mitchell Covey and I am a senior at the University of St Thomas. I am a computer science major and I am graduating this spring. 

I enjoy rock climbing, skiing, and gaming. All of these hobbies I discovered through friends I made during my time at St Thomas. I even road tripped with my roommate to Colorado to go skiing. 

I chose computer science after my freshman year. I learned how much I enjoyed coding and decided to go for it and pursue a comp sci degree.
