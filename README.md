# About me
My name is Mitchell Covey and I am a senior at the University of St Thomas. I am a computer science major and I am graduating this spring. 

I enjoy rock climbing, skiing, and gaming. All of these hobbies I discovered through friends I made during my time at St Thomas. I even road tripped with my roommate to Colorado to go skiing. 

I chose computer science after my freshman year. I learned how much I enjoyed coding and decided to go for it and pursue a comp sci degree. I have had the pleasure of taking many unique and facinating classes because of the liberal arts focus St Thomas champions. My time at St Thomas has been the most impactful years of my life and I look back on my time fondly. Below are a few projects which demonstrait some of what I learned at UST.

# Personal Website
This was the first assignment for my web dev course. The task was to create a personal website all about me. This was my first attempt at web design and I learned a lot through this assignment.

# Powerplant Dynamic Webserver
This was the second assignment for my wev dev course. Our group designed a webserver which showed off data relating to power plants around the world. This assignment was really interesting because I learned so much about counties energy usage. Seeing many large countries like the United States, China, Russia, and other countris over-reliance on fossil fuels was disheartening, but also demonstrated how important sustainable energy developments are.

# Boston Housing Predictor
This was my final assignment for my course covering deep learning. I was tasked with writing an deep learning algorithm to predict housing prices in boston. The repository includes the code and my final paper describing my findings. I enjoyed this class because it felt like a combination of my algorithms, statistics, and AI classes and helped me understand deep learning as it relates to machine learning and artificial intelligence.
